# Mapping_Earthquakes

## Project Overview
On this project we will use the tools of javascript (GeoJSON) to create interactive maps and visualize earthquake data suggested. 

## Project Purpose

The purpose of this project is to show in maps and display information on a website  the differences between the magnitudes of earthquakes all over the world for the last seven days.

## Results

To see the described website page, click on the [link](https://abramscris.github.io/Mapping_Earthquakes/).
Each earthquake is visually represented by a circle and color, where a higher magnitude will have a larger diameter and will be darker in color. In addition, each earthquake has a popup marker that, when clicked, shows the magnitude of the earthquake and the location of the earthquake. The map has three views:

* Street View
* Satellite View
* Dark View
